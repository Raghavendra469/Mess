          <p>
            A music manager plays a crucial role in an artist's career, handling business, contracts, and promotions.
            They oversee scheduling, negotiate deals, and connect artists with record labels, producers, and promoters.
            A good manager helps musicians grow their brand, secure gigs, and navigate the industryâ€™s complexities.
            They often provide career guidance, ensuring the artist stays on track creatively and financially.
