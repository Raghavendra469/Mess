            A comprehensive solution to manage royalties for artists, managers,
            and administrators seamlessly.

            A Royalty Management System is a powerful tool designed to ensure transparency and efficiency in handling music royalties. It helps automate transactions, ensuring that artists receive fair compensation for their work. By providing a clear and structured approach to royalty distribution, it eliminates discrepancies and fosters trust between artists, managers, and users.

        One of its key features is automated collaboration between artists and users. Artists can upload their songs, while users and streaming platforms can access them seamlessly. The system automatically calculates royalty earnings based on real-time streaming data, ensuring that artists receive payments accurately and on time.

        For artists, the system offers valuable insights, allowing them to track their streams, earnings, and song performance. They can also add new songs to expand their reach. Managers benefit from performance analytics, enabling them to monitor their artists' growth, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue.
